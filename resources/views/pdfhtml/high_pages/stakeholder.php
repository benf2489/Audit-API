                    <p>Technology keeps stakeholders connected and provides a platform to share and access customer data. By keeping everyone in the loop, you rarely have problems with projects losing impetus. You also experience far fewer instances of failed improvement attempts because you can combine predictive modeling results with expert stakeholder input to identify viable opportunities for improvement.</p>

                    <p>Your business has won a major cultural battle by successfully engaging stakeholders in driving customer conversions. Now, what you need to do is keep them committed and engaged as you continue to drive change.</p>

                    <p>Remember that senior stakeholders are subject to a range of pressures and influences. They have a broad set of priorities and demands on their attention. To ensure digital experience remains top of their agenda, you have to maintain regular communication and demonstration of value.</p>
