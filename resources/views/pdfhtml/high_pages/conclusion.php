                <ul>
                    <li> Is our conversion strategy still delivering, or do we need to re-align with corporate goals?</li>
                    <br>
                    <li> How could we better use our technology? Do we need to upgrade or replace any of them?</li>
                    <br>
                    <li> Is our CRO team properly resourced? Is there anything else we can provide them with?</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Are there any new metrics we could capture?</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Is our digital experience scoring still fit for purpose? Do we need to adjust our system?</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Are our stakeholders still fully engaged? What do we need to improve?</li>
