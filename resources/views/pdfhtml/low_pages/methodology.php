                                Most of your user experience monitoring is passive, reacting to issues that have already happened. You are leaving money on the table because your testing regime is not measuring at a deep enough level to maximize return on digital investments.

                    <p>You use dashboards to take a high level overview of conversions and bounce rates. But you only drill down into user pathways when something looks wrong.</p>
                    <p>Testing and improvements are done on an ad hoc basis, because you do not have a proper strategy to work with.</p>
                    <p>Your higher scoring competitors have clearly defined methodologies that are aligned with their overall business strategy. As well as measuring reactive metrics that indicate customer satisfaction (including conversion rate, retention rate, and time on site), these organizations are also collecting data on advanced experience indicators like Customer Effort Score (CES) and 'level of frustration'.</p>

                    <p>Because so much of your methodology relies on manual testing and analysis, your efforts are limited by capacity. High-scoring businesses use machine learning and artificial intelligence to automate activities, allowing them to analyze every customer journey in detail. They then have far more granular insights into what does - and does not - need improvement.</p>
