                <h2>Consumers are spoiled for choice when it comes to accessing content online. This enormous range of sources creates an existential crisis for the media and publishing industry. Providers are engaged in a constant battle to secure eyeballs and clicks to generate the revenue that keeps their services alive.</h2>

                <div class="left">

                    <p>Unfortunately, quality is no longer the only factor used by many customers when accessing content, although it is still important. Users also expect quick and easy access to the information that really matters to them.</p>
 
                    <p>Optimizing the online experience will help to attract visitors and to keep them on site for longer. But this strategy relies on effective measurement of both customer satisfaction and frustrations to continually drive improvement. This is even more important for publishers operating behind a paywall. Development and testing will be essential for teasing content and creating a frictionless sign-up process.</p>
