                <h2>Telecoms operators face a significant challenge. Having reached saturation point, it is almost impossible to source entirely new customer accounts. Instead, operators are in a constant battle to reduce customer churn, and to attract people leaving their existing provider.</h2>

                <div class="left">

                    <p>Website experience sits at the heart of these efforts. Potential customers need a seamless journey through the website, backed by a frictionless sign-up process to ensure they convert. Existing clients expect to be able to manage most of their account details online - and those processes must be quick, easy, and intuitive. The same is true of any apps provided.</p>
