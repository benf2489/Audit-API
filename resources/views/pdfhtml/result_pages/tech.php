                <h2>Despite being at the leading edge, technology companies experience the exact same problems as every other business when it comes to user experience. Websites and apps must be continuously optimized to deliver maximum conversions and return on investment.</h2>

                <div class="left">

                    <p>Tech firms offering web-based services face an additional challenge. Their entire service must be tuned to deliver an exceptional experience to keep subscribers onboard and engaged. Otherwise those customers may move to a provider who can provide the simplicity and ease they are looking for.</p>
 
                    <p>In this scenario, basic metrics like bounce rate and time on site do not provide relevant detail for optimizing an ongoing experience. Instead, technology providers need to deploy advanced technologies like heatmaps, customer behavior detection and predictive modeling to identify user frustration as well as satisfaction. These insights can then be used to direct development and enhancement efforts, and to build better products.</p>
