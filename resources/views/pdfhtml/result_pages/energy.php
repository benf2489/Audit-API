                <h2>Working in a highly regulated industry, energy organizations must collect and store a significant amount of information. The move towards online operations means that customers are increasingly expected to use the company website to complete contract licenses or to arrange payments and refunds.</h2>

                <div class="left">

                    <p>But as websites become more complex, customer churn is accelerating. Registration forms and contract documentation can be slow and laborious to complete, encouraging users to click away to a competitor with a friendlier, faster process.</p>
 
                    <p>The current situation offers energy companies a double opportunity: to capture potential customers who are visiting the site from a competitor, and to retain existing clients by delivering an exceptional digital experience.</p>

                    <p>Proactive modeling and behavior analysis will change the way energy firms think about their web assets - and help them focus their development efforts to improve experiences.</p>
