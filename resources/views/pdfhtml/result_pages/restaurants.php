                    <p>As more of the pre-dining experience moves online, restaurants must raise their game to drive sales. Customers regularly research dining spots before making a booking, so the website must engage them quickly, showing them the content they really want, and nudging them towards the online booking system effortlessly.</p>
 
                    <p>Those restaurants offering deliveries must go a step further. As well as an optimized website, they must deliver a frictionless process for selecting from the menu and arranging delivery. The system must be slick and quick to prevent customers clicking off to a competitor who offers a better experience. This remains true when ordering is handled by a third party delivery provider.</p>
