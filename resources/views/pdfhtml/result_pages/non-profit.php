                <h2>As much as people want to do good by donating to charities, very few have infinite patience. If your website is too slow, complicated, or offers a terrible user experience, donors may decide to donate elsewhere.</h2>

                <div class="left">

                    <p>With economies sluggish and budgets tight, the uphill struggle for charitable donations only becomes steeper. Those non-profit organizations that build frictionless, user-friendly websites are putting themselves in the best possible position.</p>
 
                    <p>But in order to improve the customer experience, non-profits need to be able to benchmark current performance - and progress towards the ultimate goal. This will require advanced technologies like behavior detection and session recording tools to analyze the individual customer's journey through to donation. And with the ability to turn data into action, artificial intelligence can automate personalization and other site enhancements - without hiring any additional staff.</p>
